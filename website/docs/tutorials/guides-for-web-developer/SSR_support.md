Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique in which a web server renders a full web page on the server before sending it
to the browser.

This is in contrast to Client-Side Rendering (CSR), where the browser receives a minimal HTML page and then uses
JavaScript to fetch data and generate the final content.

Since WebF have built-in support for HTML, DOM API and selectors, it had been satisfied for all the needs to running the
SSR using frameworks like Next.js (for React), Nuxt.js (for Vue).
