WebF Binding for Rust
======================

A high-performance binding library enables Rust developers to access WebF's DOM & Web API directly through Rust to C
FFI.

This library provides native-speed DOM and Web API access through WebF â€” a web browser-compatible rendering engine built
atop Flutter. It enables the creation of native-speed Flutter apps using HTML/CSS and Rust, allowing your Rust for Web
apps to run in Flutter with performance up to 3x faster than in a web browser.
